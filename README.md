Task 2: Iris Flower Classification

Objective:

         Develop a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset:

         The Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for the three species.

Key Activities:

        - Data Analysis
        - Data Pre-processing
        - Feature Engineering
        - Machine Learning Modeling

Tools Used:

        - Google Colab

Algorithm:

        - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Overview:

        This task involves using the Iris dataset, a common introductory dataset for classification tasks, to train a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
